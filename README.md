# Data Structures and Containers Exploration

**Introduction:**
This Repository summarizes my exploration of data structures using C++ and understanding how different containers interact with various data structures.

**Overview:**
During this exploration, I studied fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each assignment focused on understanding a specific data structure and its implementation in C++, along with exploring the appropriate container choices for efficient implementation.

**Topics Explored:**
1. **Arrays and Vectors:** Basics of arrays and dynamic arrays (vectors) in C++.
2. **Linked Lists:** Understanding singly and doubly linked lists.
3. **Stacks and Queues:** Exploring stack and queue data structures and their implementations.
4. **Trees:** Learning about binary trees, BSTs, and tree traversal algorithms.
5. **Graphs:** Introduction to graph data structures and traversal algorithms.

**Understanding Containers:**
Throughout the exploration, I gained insights into selecting appropriate containers from the C++ STL for different data structures based on efficiency and ease of use.

**Conclusion:**
This exploration provided a solid understanding of fundamental data structures and how to implement them in C++, along with selecting the right containers for efficient problem-solving.
